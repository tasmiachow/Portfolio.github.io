You can learn a little bit more about me. 
I constructed the design on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/QotmhGcsLqUF5oGSJiNDBa/personal-Portfolio?node-id=1-2&t=8bi1TeHzAHJqDVtD-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed) and used coolors to generate a color palette. 
I'm a first-gen student aspiring to become a software engineer!
